# Sersic-Profile-of-nearby-galaxies

Perform photometric analysis on galaxies and use the Sersic model to classify them.
Three galaxies with prominent visual constitution are considered to measure the structural parameters by fitting single-Sersic model and double-Sersic model.
Sersic index obtained by fitting the single-Sersic model to NGC 3982, NGC 2865, NGC 7773 do not show much deviation from the
existing classification of them as spiral, elliptical and barred spiral galaxy respectively. Although, the Sersic index values
are not accurate due to the foreground stars that alter the correlation between the data points. The results are compared
to existing data and discussed to provide clarity on our research.
